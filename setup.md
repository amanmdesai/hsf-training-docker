To install Docker Community Edition on your Linux, Mac, or Windows machine follow the [instructions in the Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Once you've got docker up and running, do the following docker image pulls in advance to save waiting during the tutorial:

```bash
docker pull matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker
docker pull debian:buster
docker pull python:2.7
docker pull python:3.6
docker pull python:3.7
docker pull rootproject/root-conda

```
